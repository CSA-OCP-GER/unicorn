# Implement Monitoring / Tracing #

When operating a microservice application, you quickly come to the point, where you want to have some insights of the services running in your cluster. With Istio / Kubernetes, there are several options to achive this. 

- Azure Application Insights / Azure Monitor
  - we do not cover that topic in this workshop. If you want to learn more about these options, have a look at the predecessor of the workshop (Chapter 4): https://github.com/CSA-OCP-GER/phoenix/blob/master/challenges.4.md
- Prometheus
  - open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit
- Grafana
  - open source metric analytics & visualization suite
